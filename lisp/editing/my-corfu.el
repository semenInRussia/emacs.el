;;; Commentary:

;; My configuration of `corfu'.  I choose `corfu' over `company' because
;; `company' have a big load time (about 9 secs on my computer) while `corfu'
;; 3 secs

;;; Code:

(require 'my-leaf)


(leaf corfu
  :ensure t
  :global-minor-mode global-corfu-mode
  :custom ((corfu-auto-prefix . 1)
           (corfu-auto . t)
           (corfu-auto-delay . 0.5)))

(leaf cape
  :ensure t
  :require t
  :defun (cape-symbol
          cape-dabbrev
          cape-file
          cape-elisp-block
          cape-history
          cape-keyword
          cape-sgml
          cape-tex
          cape-abbrev
          cape-symbol)
