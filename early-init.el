;; PERF: A second, case-insensitive pass over `auto-mode-alist' is time wasted.
(setq auto-mode-case-fold nil)

;; PERF: Disable bidirectional text scanning for a modest performance boost.
;;   I've set this to `nil' in the past, but the `bidi-display-reordering's docs
;;   say that is an undefined state and suggest this to be just as good:
(setq-default bidi-display-reordering 'left-to-right
              bidi-paragraph-direction 'left-to-right)

;; PERF: Disabling BPA makes redisplay faster, but might produce incorrect
;;   reordering of bidirectional text with embedded parentheses (and other
;;   bracket characters whose 'paired-bracket' Unicode property is non-nil).

;; hasn't been determined, but do it anyway, just in case. This increases memory
;; usage, however!

;; This is further increased elsewhere, where needed (like our LSP module).
