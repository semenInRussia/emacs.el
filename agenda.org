    "Fun-Logic" means that these section has name "Fun-Logic"

    Each of subdirectories has some files and yet another
    subdirectory.  First and second files are files named "Theory.pdf"
    and "Tasks.pdf" which I should download from the [[http://distmath.ru/][offical site]] of
    =zms=, third file named "Solution.tex" it's should compose each
    =LaTeX= file of the subdirectory into one document.  Subdirectory
    should be named "solutions" and contains a lot of =LaTeX= files,
    each of these files describe solution of the task and has name
    look like this followed:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    1.tex
    #+END_EXAMPLE
