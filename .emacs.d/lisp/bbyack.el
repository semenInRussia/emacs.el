;;; Commentary:

;; The Bit Bang You Are Completed package is Yet Another Completion
;; method.

;; Say you have a Lisp variable named
;; this-is-a-very-long-variable-for-example, in the buffer in which
;; this name is already typed, you can type tvvf and then press M-g
;; <return> to complete it.  You can type tvx or even tx for the same
;; effect, if you like.

;; There are also other completing methods, for e.g., to complete
;; arbitrary strings, whole lines, sexp and paragraphs. The last two
;; is not as useful as the others.

;; For more information see the readme at:
