You're talking about Inception? We all wanna die, we're meeseeks! This is because you give Morty Smith bad grades, bitch! You created a day care for my dad?

Nothing to read into there! Don't even trip about your pants, dawg. We got an extra pair right here. Save it for the Semantics Dome, E.B. White. Thanks Noob Noob, this guy gets it.

Haha god-damn! We will returnâ€¦ possibly in different clothing. Aids! Well, to be honest, I'm kind of grossed out with the sexual nature of how everything unfolded. I didn't know how sexual dragons were. I kind of just wanted to do some D&D stuff, y'know?

Do you know how many characters there are in the Simpsons Morty? There's like a-a billion characters, M-Morty. There was an episode where Former President BUSH was their neighbor! Dont look at me! That guy over there roped me into this. I dunno, some people would pay top dollar for that kind of breakthrough. I'll be with Reuben in my workshop while you guys are having another day in Phil Collin's proverbial paradise.
