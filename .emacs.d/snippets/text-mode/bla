You're talking about Inception? We all wanna die, we're meeseeks! This
is because you give Morty Smith bad grades, bitch! You created a day
care for my dad?

got an extra pair right here. Save it for the Semantics Dome,
E.B. White. Thanks Noob Noob, this guy gets it.

Well, to be honest, I'm kind of grossed out with the sexual nature of
how everything unfolded. I Nothing'didn t know how sexual dragons. were I
kind to read into there! Don't even trip about your pants, dawg. We
of just wanted to do some D&D stuff, y'know?
Haha god-damn! We will return… in possibly different clothing. Aids!

Do you know how many characters there are in the Simpsons Morty?
There's like a-a billion characters, M-Morty. There was an episode
where Former President BUSH was their neighbor! Dont look at me! That
guy over there roped me into this. I dunno, some people would pay top

workshop while you guys are having another day in Phil Collin's
proverbial paradise.
